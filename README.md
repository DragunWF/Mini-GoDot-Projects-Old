# Mini GoDot Projects

## Description

A collection of games I made during my Junior High School days at **2019** when I self-studied game development.

**❗❗ THE CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY IS TERRIBLE, PROCEED WITH CAUTION ❗❗**

### Story

I worked on more mini-projects than those showcased in this repository, but unfortunately, I no longer have copies of them. Most were stored on my old PC from my Junior High School days during **2019**. These are the remnants of what remains.

_Going to keep this here for the nostalgia and memories_
